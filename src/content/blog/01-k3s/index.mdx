## cluster initialization

### download and install

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
# Check for Ready node, 
# takes maybe 30 seconds
k3s kubectl get node
```

### setup nodes

```bash
K3S_TOKEN=SECRET k3s server --server https://masters-up
```

## plug A into B

- Tailscale is available as a binary for Raspbian, but we need to containerize it for k8s.
- Two options:
  - Dockerize: [github.com/tailscale/tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale)
  - Or Dockerize these steps:

```bash
# Raspbian Buster (for Raspberry Pi)

# Add Tailscale's GPG key
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/raspbian/buster.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the tailscale repository
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/raspbian/buster.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list

# Install Tailscale
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tailscale

# Start Tailscale!
sudo tailscale up
```

## assemble

- Check out [Tailscale Dogcam](https://tailscale.com/kb/1076/dogcam) for project inspiration
- Stress test Tailscale

## y tho

Learn & POC:

- Lightweight k8s
- Mesh VPN to turn a home machine into a jump server
- Turn iPad Pro into a thin client
- Software-defined networks
- Hardware maintenance
- Evaluate ease of automating cluster management
