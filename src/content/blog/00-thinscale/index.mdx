import Callout from "@/components/Callout.astro";

## parts requests

- 3 raspberry pi zeros
- [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) - lightweight k8s for IoT/ARM
- [tailscale](https://github.com/k8sutils/tailscale) mesh vpn instead of Wireguard

## cluster initialization

### download and install

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
# Check for Ready node, 
# takes maybe 30 seconds
k3s kubectl get node
```

### setup nodes

```bash
K3S_TOKEN=SECRET k3s server --server https://masters-up
```

## plug A into B

- Tailscale needs to be containerized to run in k8s.
- Two options:
  - Dockerize: [github.com/tailscale/tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale)
  - Or Dockerize steps below:

```bash
# Raspbian Buster (for Raspberry Pi)

# Add Tailscale's GPG key
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/raspbian/buster.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add the tailscale repository
curl https://pkgs.tailscale.com/unstable/raspbian/buster.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list

# Install Tailscale
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tailscale

# Start Tailscale!
sudo tailscale up
```

---

## assemble

- [Connect iPad Pro to Tailscale VPN](https://tailscale.com/kb/1020/install-ios)
- [Install Blink Shell on iPad](https://blink.sh)
- Use your own [k8sutils images](https://github.com/k8sutils/bash)

---

## y tho

- Launch k8s pods with task-specific containers pre-configured with your credentials (dotfiles, SSH keys, CAs as k8s secrets).
- Connect to your pod from any Tailscale device for a persistent shell session.
- Optional: connect the cluster CNI to a corporate VPN (e.g., GlobalProtect) and isolate VPN usage to the pods themselves.
- Enables a zero trust model, especially useful in WFH environments.

## notes

- Based on [this gist](http://gist.github.com/maazghani/f605d993d878093c8be3c9decc1b6d4c)
- Switched to ECDH keys with Letâ€™s Encrypt CA due to handshake delays with 4096-bit DH keys.
- For corp setups, distributing TLS infra would be too complex. Instead, use hardware tokens like [YubiKey with Duo](https://duo.com/docs/dng).
- In this model, SSH access to pods becomes trivial and secure, making password/key management obsolete.
